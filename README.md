# Local Weather App

Project for the challenge *Show the local weather*  from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).

This project will make use of the API from [Free Code Camp Weather API](https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me/). 

## Geolocation
This project will use the *navigator.geolocation* object. More information about this topic, can be found on [Using geolocation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation).

## Https server
To test the project from my development workstation, i will use the *npm* package: [simple-https-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-https-server). Using https is a must to working with geolocation.

I recomend as well this package for http testing: [serve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve).
